There are many different ways you can use our services â to search for and
share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content.
When you share information with us, for example by creating a Google_Account,
we can make those services even better â to show you more relevant search
results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others
quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how
weâre using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.
Our Privacy Policy explains:
    * What information we collect and why we collect it.
    * How we use that information.
    * The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.
Weâve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if youâre not familiar
with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about
these key_terms first. Your privacy matters to Google so whether you are new to
Google or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our
practices â and if you have any questions consult_this_page.
***** Information we collect *****
We collect information to provide better services to all of our users â from
figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things
like which ads youâll find most useful or the people who matter most to you
online.
We collect information in two ways:
    * Information you give us. For example, many of our services require you to
      sign up for a Google Account. When you do, weâll ask for personal
      information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit
      card. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we
      offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Google_Profile,
      which may include your name and photo.
    * Information we get from your use of our services. We may collect
      information about the services that you use and how you use them, like
      when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you view
      and interact with our ads and content. This information includes:
          o Device information
            We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware
            model, operating system version, unique_device_identifiers, and
            mobile network information including phone number). Google may
            associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Google
            Account.
          o Log information
            When you use our services or view content provided by Google, we
            may automatically collect and store certain information in server
            logs. This may include:
                # details of how you used our service, such as your search
                  queries.
                # telephony log information like your phone number, calling-
                  party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls,
                  duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of
                  calls.
                # Internet_protocol_address.
                # device event information such as crashes, system activity,
                  hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date
                  and time of your request and referral URL.
                # cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your
                  Google Account.
          o Location information
            When you use a location-enabled Google service, we may collect and
            process information about your actual location, like GPS signals
            sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to
            determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may,
            for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and
            cell towers.
          o Unique application numbers
            Certain services include a unique application number. This number
            and information about your installation (for example, the operating
            system type and application version number) may be sent to Google
            when you install or uninstall that service or when that service
            periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.
          o Local storage
            We may collect and store information (including personal
            information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as
            browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.
          o Cookies and anonymous identifiers
            We use various technologies to collect and store information when
            you visit a Google service, and this may include sending one or
            more cookies or anonymous_identifiers to your device. We also use
            cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services
            we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Google
            features that may appear on other sites.
***** How we use information we collect *****
We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide,
maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Google
and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content â
like giving you more relevant search results and ads.
We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the
services we offer that require a Google Account. In addition, we may replace
past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented
consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email,
or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly
visible Google Profile information, such as your name and photo.
When you contact Google, we may keep a record of your communication to help
solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform
you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or
improvements.
We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel
tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services.
For example, by saving your language preferences, weâll be able to have our
services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we
will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with sensitive categories,
such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.
We may combine personal information from one service with information,
including personal information, from other Google services â for example to
make it easier to share things with people you know. We will not combine
DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless
we have your opt-in consent.
We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than
those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.
Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries around
the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside
the country where you live.
***** Transparency and choice *****
People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what
information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is
used. For example, you can:
    * Review_and_control certain types of information tied to your Google
      Account by using Google Dashboard.
    * View_and_edit your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and
      across the web, such as which categories might interest you, using Ads
      Settings. You can also opt out of certain Google advertising services
      here.
    * Use_our_editor to see and adjust how your Google Profile appears to
      particular individuals.
    * Control who you share information with.
    * Take_information out of many of our services.
You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies
associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us.
However, itâs important to remember that many of our services may not
function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not
remember your language preferences.
***** Information you share *****
Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when
you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines,
including Google. Our services provide you with different options on sharing
and removing your content.
***** Accessing and updating your personal information *****
Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your
personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways
to update it quickly or to delete it â unless we have to keep that
information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your
personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act
on your request.
We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require
disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or
fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or
would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information
residing on backup systems).
Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free,
except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our
services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious
destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services,
we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may
not remove information from our backup systems.
***** Information we share *****
We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and
individuals outside of Google unless one of the following circumstances
applies:
    * With your consent
      We will share personal information with companies, organizations or
      individuals outside of Google when we have your consent to do so. We
      require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive_personal
      information.
    * With domain administrators
      If your Google Account is managed for you by a domain_administrator (for
      example, for Google Apps users) then your domain administrator and
      resellers who provide user support to your organization will have access
      to your Google Account information (including your email and other data).
      Your domain administrator may be able to:
          o view statistics regarding your account, like statistics regarding
            applications you install.
          o change your account password.
          o suspend or terminate your account access.
          o access or retain information stored as part of your account.
          o receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable
            law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
          o restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy
            settings.
      Please refer to your domain administratorâs privacy policy for more
      information.
    * For external processing
      We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted
      businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and
      in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate
      confidentiality and security measures.
    * For legal reasons
      We will share personal information with companies, organizations or
      individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access,
      use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably
      necessary to:
          o meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable
            governmental request.
          o enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of
            potential violations.
          o detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical
            issues.
          o protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google,
            our users or the public as required or permitted by law.
We may share aggregated, non-personally_identifiable_information publicly and
with our partners â like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For
example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use
of our services.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue
to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected
users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a
different privacy policy.
***** Information security *****
We work hard to protect Google and our users from unauthorized access to or
unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In
particular:
    * We encrypt many of our services using_SSL.
    * We offer you two_step_verification when you access your Google Account,
      and a Safe_Browsing_feature in Google Chrome.
    * We review our information collection, storage and processing practices,
      including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized
      access to systems.
    * We restrict access to personal information to Google employees,
      contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to
      process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual
      confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they
      fail to meet these obligations.
***** Application *****
Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google Inc. and
its affiliates, including services offered on other sites (such as our
advertising services), but excludes services that have separate privacy
policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.
Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or
individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you in search
results, sites that may include Google services, or other sites linked from our
services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other
companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use
cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.
***** Enforcement *****
We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to
several self_regulatory_frameworks. When we receive formal written complaints,
we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with
the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection
authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data
that we cannot resolve with our users directly.
***** Changes *****
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights
under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any
privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we
will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email
notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of
this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
