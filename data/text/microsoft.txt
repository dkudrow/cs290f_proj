This privacy statement applies to websites and services of Microsoft that
collect data and display these terms, as well as its offline product support
services. It does not apply to those Microsoft sites, services and products
that do not display or link to this statement or that have their own privacy
statements.
Please read the Microsoft Online Privacy Statement below and also any
supplemental information listed to the right for further details about
particular Microsoft sites and services you use. Some products, services or
features mentioned in this statement may not be available in all markets at
this time. Additional information on Microsoft‚Äôs commitment to protecting your
privacy can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/privacy.
***** Collection of Your Personal Information *****
‚ÄAt some Microsoft sites, we ask you to provide personal information, such as
  your e-mail address, name, home or work address, or telephone number. We may
  also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender,
  preferences, interests and favorites. If you choose to make a purchase or
  sign up for a paid subscription service, we will ask for additional
  information, such as your credit card number and billing address.
‚ÄIn order to access some Microsoft services, you will be asked to sign in with
  an e-mail address and password, which we refer to as your Microsoft account.
  By signing in on one Microsoft site or service, you may be automatically
  signed into other Microsoft sites and services that use Microsoft account.
  For more information, see the Windows Live ID privacy supplement.
‚ÄWe collect additional information about your interaction with Microsoft sites
  and services without identifying you as an individual. For example, we
  receive certain standard information that your browser sends to every website
  you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times
  and referring Web site addresses. We also use Web site analytics tools on our
  sites to retrieve information from your browser, including the site you came
  from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you used to find our site, the
  pages you view within our site, your browser add-ons, and your browser's
  width and height.
‚ÄWe use technologies, such as cookies and web beacons (described below), to
  collect information about the pages you view, the links you click and other
  actions you take on our sites and services.
‚ÄWe also deliver advertisements (see the Display of Advertising section below)
  and provide Web site analytics tools on non-Microsoft sites and services, and
  we collect information about page views on these third party sites as well.
‚ÄWhen you receive newsletters or promotional e-mail from Microsoft, we may use
  web beacons (described below), customized links or similar technologies to
  determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in
  order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information.
In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your
interactions with Microsoft, information collected through one Microsoft
service may be combined with information obtained through other Microsoft
services. We may also supplement the information we collect with information
obtained from other companies. For example, we may use services from other
companies that enable us to derive a general geographic area based on your IP
address in order to customize certain services to your geographic area.
[Top_of_page]Top_of_page
***** Use of Your Personal Information *****
Microsoft collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve
its sites and services. These uses include providing you with more effective
customer service; making the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the
need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and
analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and
displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and
preferences. For more information about the use of information for advertising,
see the Display_of_Advertising section below.
We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send
certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing
reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements.
Some Microsoft services, such as Windows Live Hotmail, may send periodic member
letters that are considered part of the service. Additionally, with your
permission, we may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional
mailings to inform you of other products or services available from Microsoft
and its affiliates, and/or share your personal information with Microsoft
partners so they may send you information about their products and services.
You can opt-out from receiving newsletters or promotional e-mail anytime by
using this web form or by following the steps as described in the respective
newsletter or promotional e-mail.
Personal information collected on Microsoft sites and services may be stored
and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or
its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities.
Microsoft abides by the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe
Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the
collection, use, and retention of data from the European Economic Area, and
Switzerland. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our
certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor.
[Top_of_page]Top_of_page
***** Sharing of Your Personal Information *****
Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal
information outside of Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates
without your consent. Some Microsoft sites allow you to choose to share your
personal information with select Microsoft partners so that they can contact
you about their products, services or offers. Other sites, such as MSN instead
may give you a separate choice as to whether you wish to receive communications
from Microsoft about a partner's particular offering (without transferring your
personal information to the third party). See the Communication Preferences
section below for more information.
Some Microsoft services are co-branded by Microsoft and another company
(partner). If you register to or use such a service, both a Microsoft privacy
statement and the partner‚Äôs privacy statement may be displayed. If so, both
Microsoft and the partner will receive information you provide such as on
registration forms.
Microsoft occasionally hires other companies (vendor) to provide limited
services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of
mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing
transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those service
providers will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need
to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of
the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose than for
delivering the service to Microsoft in accordance with Microsoft‚Äôs instructions
and policies. However, our vendors may use aggregate data for fraud detection
to help improve their services. This helps them to more accurately detect
fraudulent transactions. We may access or disclose information about you,
including the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the
law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or
property of Microsoft or our customers, including the enforcement of our
agreements or policies governing your use of the services; or (c) act on a good
faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the
personal safety of Microsoft employees, customers or the public. We may also
disclose personal information as part of a corporate transaction such as a
merger or sale of assets.
[Top_of_page]Top_of_page

***** Communication Preferences *****
You can stop the delivery of future promotional e-mail from Microsoft sites and
services by following the specific instructions in the e-mail you receive.
Depending on the respective service, you may also have the option of

receipt of mandatory service communications that are considered part of certain
Microsoft services, which you may receive periodically unless you cancel the
service.
[Top_of_page]Top_of_page
***** Display of Advertising (Opt-Out) *****
Many of our Web sites and online services are supported by advertising.
Most of the online advertisements on Microsoft sites are displayed by Microsoft
Advertising. When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or
more persistent cookies on your computer in order to recognize your computer
each time we display an ad to you. Because we serve advertisements on our own
websites as well as those of our advertising and publisher partners, we are
able to compile information over time about the types of pages, content and ads
you, or others who are using your computer, visited or viewed. This information
is used for many purposes, for example, it helps us try to ensure that you do
not see the same advertisements over and over again. We also use this
information to help select and display targeted advertisements that we believe
may be of interest to you.
You may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from Microsoft Advertising by
visiting our opt-out_page. For more information about how Microsoft Advertising
collects and uses information, please see the Microsoft_Advertising_Privacy
Supplement.
We also allow third-party ad companies, including other ad networks, to display
advertisements on our sites. In some cases, these third parties may also place
cookies on your computer. These companies currently include, but are not
limited to: 24/7_Real_Media, aCerno,Inc, AdBlade, AdConion, AdFusion,
Advertising.com, AppNexus, Bane_Media, Brand.net, CasaleMedia, Collective
Media, Fox_Interactive, Interclick, Millennial, PrecisionClick, ROI_Media,
Social_Media, SpecificMedia, TrafficMarketplace, Tribal_Fusion, ValueClick,
Yahoo!, YuMe, and Zumobi. These companies may offer you a way to opt-out of ad
targeting based on their cookies. You may find more information by clicking on
the company names above and following the links to the Web sites of each
company. Many of them are also members of the Network_Advertising_Initiative or
the Digital_Advertising_Alliance, which each provide a simple way to opt-out of
ad targeting from participating companies.
[Top_of_page]Top_of_page
***** Security of Your Personal Information *****
Microsoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal information.
We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your
personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example,
we store the personal information we collect on computer systems with limited
access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly
confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the
Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure
Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information,
it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this
information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should
always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your
information from subsequent users.
[Top_of_page]Top_of_page
***** Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information *****
Many Microsoft sites and services are intended for general audiences and do not
knowingly collect any personal information from children. When a Microsoft site
does collect age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the
site will either block such users from providing personal information, or will
seek to obtain consent from parents for the collection, use and sharing of
their children's personal information. We will not knowingly ask children under
the age of 13 to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to
provide our services.
Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use Microsoft services,
this will include such general audience communication services as e-mail,
instant messaging, and online groups, and your child will be able to
communicate with, and disclose personal information to, other users of all
ages. Parents can change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and
review, edit or request the deletion of their children's personal information.
For example, on MSN and Windows Live, parents can visit Account Services, and
click on ‚ÄúPermission for kids.‚Äù If we change this privacy statement in a way
that expands the collection, use or disclosure of children's personal
information to which a parent has previously consented, the parent will be
notified and we will be required to obtain the parent's additional consent.
If you have an MSN Premium, MSN Plus, or MSN 9 Dial-Up account, and use MSN
Client software version 9.5 or below, you can choose to set up MSN Parental
Controls for the other users of that account. Please read the supplemental
privacy information for MSN for further information.
We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers
and disclosing personal information online. You and your child can visit our
online_safety_resources for additional information about using the Internet
safely.
[Top_of_page]Top_of_page
***** Use of Cookies *****
Most Microsoft Web sites use "cookies," which are small text files placed on
your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies contain information that can later be
read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to store your preferences and other
information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need
to repeatedly enter the same information and to display your personalized
content and targeted advertising on your later visits to these sites. Microsoft
Web sites also use cookies as described in the Display_of_Advertising sections
of this privacy statement.
When you sign in to a site using your Microsoft account, we store your unique
ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard
disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without
having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are
deleted from your computer. We also use cookies to improve the sign in
experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that
will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail
address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password
the next time you sign in. If you are using a public computer or do not
otherwise want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate
radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting
to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not
be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Microsoft sites and
services that depend on cookies, and some advertising preferences that are
dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected.
If you choose to accept cookies, you also have the ability to later delete
cookies that you have accepted. For example, in Internet Explorer 8, you can
delete cookies by selecting ‚ÄúTools‚Äù, ‚ÄúDelete browsing history‚Äù. Then select the
control box ‚ÄúCookies" and click the ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù button. If you choose to delete
cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including
advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.
[Top_of_page]Top_of_page
***** Use of Web Beacons *****
Microsoft Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons -
sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to assist in delivering
cookies on our sites and allow us to count users who have visited those pages
and to deliver co-branded services. We may include Web beacons in promotional
e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have
been opened and acted upon.
Microsoft may also employ Web beacons from third parties in order to help us
compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional
campaigns or other operations of our sites. We prohibit Web beacons on our
sites from being used by third parties to collect or access your personal
information.
Finally, we may work with other companies that advertise on Microsoft sites to
place Web beacons on their sites in order to allow us to develop statistics on
how often clicking on an advertisement on a Microsoft site results in a
purchase or other action on the advertiser's site.
[Top_of_page]Top_of_page
***** Controlling Unsolicited E-mail ("Spam") *****
Microsoft is concerned about controlling unsolicited commercial e-mail, or
"spam." Microsoft has a strict Anti-Spam_Policy prohibiting the use of a
Windows Live Hotmail or other Microsoft-provided e-mail account to send spam.
Microsoft will not sell, lease or rent its e-mail subscriber lists to third
parties. . While Microsoft continues to actively review and implement new
technology, such as expanded filtering features, there is no technology that
will totally prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited e-mail. Using
junk e-mail tools and being cautious about the sharing of your e-mail address
while online will help reduce the amount of unsolicited e-mail you receive.
[Top_of_page]Top_of_page
***** Enforcement of This Privacy Statement *****
If you have questions regarding this statement, you should first contact us by
using our Web_form. If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or
your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact
TRUSTe at http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php. TRUSTe will
serve as a liaison with Microsoft to resolve your concerns.
[Top_of_page]Top_of_page
***** Changes to This Privacy Statement *****
We will occasionally update this privacy statement to reflect changes in our
services and customer feedback. When we post changes to this Statement, we will
revise the "last updated" date at the top of this statement. If there are
material changes to this statement or in how Microsoft will use your personal
information, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such
changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a
notification. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to be
informed of how Microsoft is protecting your information.
