This can include your name, profile photo, pins, comments, likes, email address you used to sign up, and any other information you provide us. If you're using Pinterest on your mobile device, you can also choose to provide us with location data. 

For example, you may link your Facebook or Twitter account to Pinterest, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your friends or contacts). 

Log Data. When you use Pinterest or go to a webpage or use an app that has Pinterest features (like our "Pin It" button), our servers automatically record information ("log data") including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you're using it. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web pages you visited that had Pinterest features, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used Pinterest, and cookie data. 

      Cookie data. Depending on how you're accessing our products, we may use "cookies" (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Pinterest account or your browser), or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use "session" cookies (that last until you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other Pinterest settings so you don't have to set them up every time you visit Pinterest. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Pinterest account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not. 

      Device Information. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you're using Pinterest on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you're using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data.
